# University of Utah / SCI Satellite

IEEE VIS is the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics.

## Satellite Event

As VIS24 is to be held remote this year, we are organizing a satellite event at the University of Utah. The event will be held on October 15-18 from 6am to 3pm. The event will generally be in the [Warnock Engineering Building](<https://www.google.com/maps/place/Warnock+Engineering+Building+(WEB)/@40.7677631,-111.8474332,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87525f91e2e11b31:0x66eb3e5e585fbdd4!8m2!3d40.7677631!4d-111.8448583!16s%2Fg%2F1yl498l5s?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D>), with some exceptions. Broadly this event is framed as a group watching party, where we will stream talks of interest. A number of our faculty and students are giving talks as well, which will be presented live.
