# University of Utah / SCI Satellite

IEEE VIS is the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics.

## Satellite Event

As VIS24 is to be held remote this year, we are organizing a satellite event at the University of Utah. The event will be held on October 15-18 from 6am to 3pm. The event will generally be in the [Warnock Engineering Building](<https://www.google.com/maps/place/Warnock+Engineering+Building+(WEB)/@40.7677631,-111.8474332,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87525f91e2e11b31:0x66eb3e5e585fbdd4!8m2!3d40.7677631!4d-111.8448583!16s%2Fg%2F1yl498l5s?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D>), with some exceptions. This event will include viewing of live streamed VIS24 talks, live talks from faculty and students, and social events. There will be substantial time for networking and discussion.
